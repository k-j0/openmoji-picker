# OpenMoji Picker
A simple hassle-free vanilla JavaScript emoji picker that can be integrated to allow users to enter [OpenMojis](https://openmoji.org/) on websites

Still in very early development phase, don't expect anything stable right now.

## To use
Copy the [openmoji-picker](openmoji-picker) folder to your project folders and include [openmoji-picker/script.js](openmoji-picker/script.js) to get started.
